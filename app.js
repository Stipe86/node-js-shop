// This line specifies the directory where your view files (Pug templates) are located.

// Old route handler using static HTML file (before Pug integration). This code was used to serve `404.html` directly from the views folder:
// app.use((req, res, next) => {
//   res.status(404).sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "views", "404.html"));
// });

// This setup uses Pug as the templating engine to render the `404.pug` file. Since we set Pug as the default view engine and the `views` folder as the default location, we donâ€™t need to specify the file extension (shop.pug) or the full path to the template (to that folder). Express will automatically look for `404.pug` in the `views` directory and use it to generate the HTML response
